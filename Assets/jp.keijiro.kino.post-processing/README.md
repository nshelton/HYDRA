Effects
-------

### Streak

**Streak** adds horizontally stretched bloom that roughly resembles anamorphic
lens flares. Although it's neither physically correct nor energy conserving,
it's handy to emphasize shininess of the scene in just a few clicks.

### Recolor

**Recolor** is a kind of [false color] effect that replaces image colors by
mapping luminance to a given gradient. It also supports edge detection effect
to add contour lines to the images.

### Overlay

**Overlay** simply adds a color gradient to the final output of the post
process. It's handy to widen the color spectrum of the output in a nearly
subliminal level.

### Glitch

(`Packages/manifest.json`).

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

#### Nothing happens when I add effects to a volume

Check the Default HDRP Settings in the Project Settings. You have to
define custom post processing orders to make them take effect in the
pipeline.
